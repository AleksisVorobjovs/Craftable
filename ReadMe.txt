This game is made to test the players Minecraft crafting knowledge.

When starting the game, randomly selected items are added to the inventory.
Among these items are some that together make a different item.
The goal of the game is to guess this specific recipe.

The user does this by placing blocks and items from the inventory into the crafting menu in a specific pattern.
The background will light up green, if the item is in the recipe and can be in that spot.
The background will light up yellow, if the item is in the recipe, but can't be placed in that spot.
And if the item is not in the recipe, nothing will happen.

The player wins when the input items would create the target item in minecraft.
